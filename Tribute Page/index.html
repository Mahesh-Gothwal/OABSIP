        show was the romantic drama Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008), followed
        by the lead role in the soap opera Pavitra Rishta (2009–2011). He made
        his film debut with the film adaptation Kai Po Che! (2013) which became
        a critical and commercial success. He followed up with his starring
        roles as a tourist guide in the romantic comedy Shuddh Desi Romance

        filed abetment charges against them. Abetment to suicide charges were
        filed against his former girlfriend, while the Supreme Court refused to
        quash a case against his sister Priyanka which alleged she had supplied
        him psychotrophic anti-depressants without proper medical consultation,
        using a forged prescription. His last film, Dil Bechara (2020), was
        released posthumously on the streaming platform Hotstar.
